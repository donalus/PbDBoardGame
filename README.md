# Privacy By Design Boardgame

This project is an boardgame-like activity meant to engage teams in discussion 
and decision-making about ethical and privacy issues that occure during the 
development of a fictional mobile-application. The project is the result of NSF-funded
research to identify factors that encourage discussion and action on ethical challenges.



This application was developed as a part of the project 
Ethical Computing in Mobile & Wearable App Development.
